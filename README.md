### 31-05-20-liver-rora-peaks-filtering-enhancers.py
Filtering enhancer regions for integrative omics

Here I processed integrated transcriptomics and genomics data obtained using ChromHMM software. I filter some functional genomic regions  for further analysis using python language and pandas library

### terms-from-cistrome-go.py
Pick significantly changed GO terms

Small python script scanning output of cistrome GO tool and finding terms with FDR < 0.05


## sc-rna-seq
### Tabula_muris_lung.R (and plots in pdf)
small scRNA-seq analysis of Tabula Muris data set

A test of Tabula Muris data set using Seurat R package.
The aim was to check if there's enough immune cells of our interest to test further hypotheses


## chip-seq
### 18-07-19-csaw-treg-h3k27ac.R
ChIP-seq differential binding analysis using csaw

Histone H3K27Ac ChIP-seq data analysed in wt and ko cells for differential binding using csaw R package.


### commands-13-july-2021.sh
Difference between genome-wide ChIP-seq signals

Here I normalized, compared, calculated mean signals of several ChIP-seq signal files (BigWig) using various tools.

### deeptools-for-chip-seq.sh
ChIP-seq signal profiling using deeptools

Here I tested histone ChIP-seq signals using a set of regions of interest and plotted heatmaps to visualize those signals

### rora-putative-sites-treg-vs-liver.pdf
Visualization of ChIP-seq binding signals

In this image I compared signals in ChIP-seq data from literature (Liver RORa ChIP-seq) with our data (Treg RORa ChIP-seq)


## microarray
### TregMA_v1.R
Microarray analysis using limma R package
